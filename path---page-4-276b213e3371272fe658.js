Go is a compiled, statically typed language and I thought it would be a great fit for situations where Node.js, my primary go-to stack, won\'t be a great candidate for the job. For heavy processing and problems where concurrent-first solutions must be applied.</p>\n<p>The first thing I did was to check the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online tour</a> on the official site. It\'s very well structured and has also some exercises to get you started. Wrapping my head around the language was very easy since it has a lot of well-known concepts like pointers and structs, similar to C.</p>\n<p>After playing a bit around I thought I would make something using my new learnings and Go. I found a <a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really cool project</a> and wanted to contribute to it. So I thought I will fork it and create a bootstrap application and try to import my fork. But that strange message appeared on my console:</p>\n<div class="gatsby-highlight">\n      <pre class="language-none"><code>package github.com/kbariotis/imageproxy: code in directory /Users/Bariotis/golang/src/github.com/kbariotis/imageproxy expects import "willnorris.com/go/imageproxy"</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>what this basically means is that my repo had an explicit [canonical import path]<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Import_path_checking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Import<em>path</em>checking</a>) set that was forcing the consumer to download it from a <a href="https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy/blob/master/imageproxy.go#L17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">particular place</a> and that was the original author\'s site.</p>\n<p><a href="https://texlution.com/post/golang-canonical-import-paths/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post</a> explains even more how this works. Since the Go command allows one to import packages from remote servers and a package may live in various places or it can be moved from one place to another, the maintainer must explicitly set the default URL that others must use to import the library, in order to avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link rot</a>.</p>\n<p>But that confused me a bit since I do this all the time with <code>npm</code>. I can fork a library and import it from my fork directly.</p>\n<p>I searched a bit around and found that the simplest thing to do (and didn\'t think of it) was to import the original repository and the Go command will clone it into my $GOPATH/src directory. From there I could change the git remotes URLs and send any changes onto my fork. Then make a PR to the original repo or change the canonical import path annotation if I wanted to use my fork directly.</p>\n<p>Keep this in mind if you\'re just starting with the Go language.

Goodvidio is getting bigger and bigger and that pushes me to become a better programmer and a better professional.</li>\n<li>Lots of travelling. I went to Sofia, Brussels, Cyprus and Athens. Not to mention the usual snowboarding weekend road trips. Unfortunately, our trip to Paris has been canceled due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November\'s Paris attack</a>.

Speaking in conferences is not only about talking to other people. It\'s also about listening to what others have to say about you.</li>\n<li>Lots of reading. 2015 wasn\'t so much of tech reading like the years before. I\'ve read a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classics</a>, as much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saviors_of_God" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literature</a> and <a href="https://37signals.com/rework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuff</a>.</li>\n<li>I\'ve actively engaged with the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nodejs meetup</a> and helped a lot on the processes.

The only goal was to take as much as I could out of it. But now, I want 2016 to be more structured and goal oriented.\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And my goals for 2016:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to travel more. I\'ve found that tech conferences are a great excuse for that.</li>\n<li>Even more reading and writing to my blog. Writing and maintaining a blog is hard. My problem is that I don\'t want to be publishing stuff that are not perfect and don\'t meet my reading standards. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5864004/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-to-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But we should laugh at perfection</a>. There is no such thing. As an experiment, I will try to write as much as possible. This has to be the only way to become better. But, there can\'t be writing without reading and in 2016 I must keep a balance between reading tech oriented and other books. I need not to be left behind in the tech scene but also to start dusty corners of information that I had never seen before.</li>\n<li>I want to speak to an international conference. That it\'s going to be a challenge and way out my comfort zone. Still, I think, the benefits from doing such a move are going to be huge. I must not miss that opportunity.</li>\n<li>It\'s been a long time now since I wanted to be in a better physical shape. Unfortunately, 2015 wasn\'t the year for that. I am following a good diet and I am not eating much of junk no more. But I really need  to invest on the weight lifting more. 2016 will be the year for that.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Laugh at perfection.
