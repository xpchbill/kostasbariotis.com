With AWS Lambda, e.g. what I can do is to make a POST request on their API with some Node.js source code and it will return me a UID that I can use on another POST request to run it. That\'s it. No cluster setup, no ports binding. It\'s just takes my code and runs it.</p>\n<p>Serverless hides its roots in the microservices architectures were bigger and complex systems are being broken out in multiple isolated services. The goal is to abstract away complex parts of our codebase from the other developers and let them interact with those through an API.</p>\n<p>And like a monolith that you decided to break it down in smaller services, is something that you can progresivelly fade in. You don\'t have to go one hundred percent serverless.</p>\n<h2 id="functionsdatabaserouteretc-as-a-service"><a href="#functionsdatabaserouteretc-as-a-service" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Functions/Database/Router/etc... as a Service</h2>\n<p>Think of a simple CRUD REST API. We need a database, a runtime to run our code and an HTTP proxy/router. Each of these has its own caveats and things that we have to take actions for. Database needs indexing and backups operations, our runtime needs a scaling protocol and the proxy needs an authentication mechanism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Anything that can be abstracted away, will be abstracted away.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By putting all of the above, behind an API(one API for each service, remember the bounded context?) and let them take handle of their own issues, the only thing we left with is "our code".</p>\n<p>It\'s a form of outsourcing really, with a more simplified communication process.</p>\n<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Bezos once</a> instructed every team inside Amazon to have a developer that will create an API for that team and let all teams communicate only through these APIs. Thus AWS was born. Serverless is that particular mindset in scale.</p>\n<h2 id="not-simpler"><a href="#not-simpler" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Not simpler</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Now you are able to focus on writing your code...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know. Such a cliche.</p>\n<p>In reality, it\'s not that simple. And while I am feeling like we are getting there, it\'s still not possible.</p>\n<p>While serverless and the current state can boost development, it\'s still not that simple. You still need to have a knowledge of how servers works, basic understanding of distributed systems and security.</p>\n<p>On top of that, each external API has each own caveats and terminology you will need to get familiar with.</p>\n<p>There are also cons that you will have take in consideration, such as the vendor lock in. Out sourcing your work means that you are bringing in partners. You need to think about each and every one of them.</p>\n<p>The development tools around a serverless architecture is also still a blurry place to be. A local development will be hard, often times impossible to setup. Consider that early in your architecture design in order to avoid surprises later on.</p>\n<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Serverless is an amazing technology, or a mindset if you will.
