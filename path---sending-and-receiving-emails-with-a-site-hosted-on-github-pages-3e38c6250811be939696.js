This is how I did it.</p>\n<p><a href="http://devastation.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devastation.tv</a>, my podcast for developers (for the time in Greek only) is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/kbariotis/devastation-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub Pages</a> with a custom domain that I have purchased from <a href="https://namecheap.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Namecheap</a>. I wanted to be able to send email campaigns to my subscribers whenever a new episode is out.</p>\n<p><a href="https://mailchimp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mailchimp</a> helped me a lot on my first campaigns but I would send those emails using my personal Gmail account, which is both ugly for the subscriber to see and is <a href="http://kb.mailchimp.com/accounts/email-authentication/about-dmarc?_ga=1.191860521.246269979.1477844435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also dangerous</a> cause it may end up in my subscriber\'s Spam folder.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I knew my subscriber list would take a long time until it go big and I didn\'t want to pay for a paid subscription, e.g. to Gmail for Work (£3.30 per user per month). I had to find a cheaper way, and Mailchimp has a great starter package with up to 2,000 subscribers and 12,000 emails per month.</p>\n<p>So here\'s a simple solution that involves having your site hosted on GitHub Pages, using Mailchimp for sending email campaigns and Namecheap as your domain registrar.</p>\n<h2 id="receiving-emails"><a href="#receiving-emails" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Receiving emails</h2>\n<p>For receiving emails, Namecheap has this great <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/308/76/how-can-i-set-up-free-email-forwarding-for-my-domain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email forwarding feature</a> that allows you to forward an incoming email to your domain in an external email.

But why you say.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up I had to deal with two things: a) I didn't had the money to do anything I wanted to do and b) I had to do shitty jobs to get that money.</p>\n<p>So I had to find a solution. I was introduced to programming and everyone were talking about how is the job of the future. I fall in love with it since my first key strokes. I made my decision at that moment.</p>\n<p>I had a mentor back then. My cousin. 20 years of experience more than me and he really wanted to stack them all in my head. Once he said to me: \"There are two options in life. You can either be a cow, walking around the same grass land your whole life or you can be a hawk, flying and traveling every day and watching the world from the sky. You got choose.\" That completely messed up my childhood. I had to find a way to be hawk.</p>\n<p>I don't like long term goals. Even for my longest goals I will break them into smaller tasks and commit to those.</p>\n<p>My most long term goal was and still is one. Is the one that I set when I was a kid in order to solve my problems.</p>\n<p>To be a high paid professional in my industry until my thirtieth birthday.</p>\n<p>Let's break that down:</p>\n<p>Professional: I love programming and that is the primary reason I do it for living. If I didn't do it for any reason, I would probably doing it in my free time. I wrote my first lines of code in the age of 10. That was it for me. Right there I discovered what I wanted to do in life.</p>\n<p>High paid: Not just paying the bills. I want to be high paid. Have you ever declined a suggestion for a road trip or even to get out for some drinks, cause you couldn't afford it? Yeah, I know. I don't want this. I want money to not be problem. They're supposed to be the ticket, not the barrier.</p>\n<p>The original goal was until the age of 25. I failed, so I rescheduled it. If I were to predict my next deadline, I would say I won't fail this time. Even if I do, I will just set the next goal and move on. I had enough.</p>",id:"/home/travis/build/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/blog/the-reason-i-do-what-i-do/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:"2016-10-20T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/drafts/the-reason-i-do-what-i-do/",tags:null,title:"The reason I do what I do",draft:!0}}}}}});
