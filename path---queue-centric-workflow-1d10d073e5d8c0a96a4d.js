Thus, loose coupling of the dependent services can be achieved.</p>\n<p>The essential part here is that we are going from a <em>direct response of the Server</em> model to a <em>I will process that later, continue with what you\'re doing</em> model, moving towards a Tasks Based workflow. It\'s a great candidate for time consuming processes or when the possibility of a system to be down is high and won\'t be able to service requests immediately. The <em>at-least-once delivery</em> of requests can be guaranteed.</p>\n<p>By Queue we are referring to a service that implements the standard data structure Queue and sits between a Producer and a Consumer. The Producers generates requests and puts them in the Queue via an <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/MakingRequestsArticle.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API</a>. The Consumer then reads the Queue and processes them. The communication is asynchronous which mean that the Producers won\'t get an immediate response from the requests that sends.  Instead the Consumer may then choose to somehow inform the Producer about the results. Either by sending an email to the admin or by sending a message through a WebSocket that can then be displayed directly to the user.</p>\n<h2 id="why-to-use-it"><a href="#why-to-use-it" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Why to use it</h2>\n<p>While there are a lot of problems such a workflow can solve, the most common one is that the processing part of our application can\'t handle eager clients that are sending requests too fast or send requests that will take too long to process.</p>\n<p>The Producers can send requests to the Consumer, through the Queue, as aggressively as he wants, but the Consumer will process them based on the current workload.</p>\n<p>By keeping Requests to a separate place we can also not worry about losing requests since the Consumer can go off and back online again and start processing requests from the point where he left them.</p>\n<p>There are many more gains but we found those to be the most essential problems we need to solve.</p>\n<h2 id="consuming-the-queue"><a href="#consuming-the-queue" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Consuming the Queue</h2>\n<p>A complex thing about consuming a Queue is that of the Consumer and the policy he follows for reading and processing messages. In general, the flow goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get the next available message from the top of the Queue</li>\n<li>Process the message</li>\n<li>Delete the message</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It\'s essential to note that you need the message that is in the the top of the queue. Otherwise, you can\'t guarantee that all messages will be processed in the same time period. You need the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FIFO</a></strong> policy. Unfortunately, AWS SQS can\'t guarantee that for you, because of their distributed nature and you have to implement such functionality by your self.</p>\n<h3 id="long-polling"><a href="#long-polling" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Long Polling</h3>\n<p>In order to get new messages, you have to ask the Queue once in a while if it has any messages. That\'s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12855533/1955940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polling</a>. Several implementation provides some sort of Pushing mechanism that will directly notify a Consumer that there are pending messages to be processed. SQS doesn\'t support that, but they support <strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-long-polling.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Long Polling</a></strong> which is actually when we ask the Queue for new messages and if there are none, the connection is being kept alive until there is one or till the connection times out. SQS supports up to 20 seconds of Long Polling. After that, we must re ask the Queue and wait another 20 seconds.</p>\n<h3 id="visibility-timeout"><a href="#visibility-timeout" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Visibility Timeout</h3>\n<p>While processing a message, a lot of things can go wrong that will make the process to fail. In such case, the message can\'t be deleted and must remain in the Queue in order to reprocess it. But if we leave it there, it\'s going to be returned over and over again and we can\'t be sure that is going to succeed the next time. Instead of deleting the message, the Queue can hide it for a specific period of time, so we can continue processing other messages and reprocess that message at some point in the future again. This is a <strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/AboutVT.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Queue\'s Visibility Timeout</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3 id="poisoned-messages"><a href="#poisoned-messages" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Poisoned Messages</h3>\n<p>Still, this won\'t guarantee that the message will be processed successfully at any time. The message may be poisoned, that means that it failed passing our domain\'s model requirements and that it won\'t be processed unless we change our logic. Those are called <strong>Poison Messages</strong> and a policy must be specified that will take care of those. For example, a counter may be kept for each poisoned message and after the third time that it failed to be processed it must be deleted.</p>\n<h3 id="dead-letter-queues"><a href="#dead-letter-queues" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Dead Letter Queues</h3>\n<p>In case of such a failure, you don\'t want to bypass that without investigating the cause. You\'ll need to know what was the reason that marked the message as poisoned. Hopefully, instead of deleting it after the third attempt, you can store it in a <strong><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/SQSDeadLetterQueue.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead Letter Queue</a></strong>. A Dead Letter Queue is simply another Queue that holds only the failed messages. Those can be messages that couldn\'t be processed or messages that couldn\'t be pushed in the Queue cause it\'s full or non responding. After you store them there, you can go back at any time and examine those messages and see what you have done wrong in the first place.</p>\n<h2 id="finally"><a href="#finally" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Finally</h2>\n<p>So we talked about what a QCW is, how it can be used and also for some key concepts of SQS such as Queue\'s Visibility Timeout, Polling, Poison Messages and Dead Letter Queues.

I\'ve read a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">classics</a>, as much as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saviors_of_God" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">literature</a> and <a href="https://37signals.com/rework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="http://zerotoonebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stuff</a>.</li>\n<li>I\'ve actively engaged with the local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nodejs meetup</a> and helped a lot on the processes.

The only goal was to take as much as I could out of it.

I\'ve found that tech conferences are a great excuse for that.</li>\n<li>Even more reading and writing to my blog. Writing and maintaining a blog is hard. My problem is that I don\'t want to be publishing stuff that are not perfect and don\'t meet my reading standards. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5864004/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-to-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But we should laugh at perfection</a>. There is no such thing. As an experiment, I will try to write as much as possible. This has to be the only way to become better. But, there can\'t be writing without reading and in 2016 I must keep a balance between reading tech oriented and other books. I need not to be left behind in the tech scene but also to start dusty corners of information that I had never seen before.</li>\n<li>I want to speak to an international conference. That it\'s going to be a challenge and way out my comfort zone. Still, I think, the benefits from doing such a move are going to be huge. I must not miss that opportunity.</li>\n<li>It\'s been a long time now since I wanted to be in a better physical shape. Unfortunately, 2015 wasn\'t the year for that.

We were in a need of an auditing service that will track down every movement inside our system.</p>\n<p>Searching in Google we didn't find any real world example either any useful information as we expected. We had only our experience from the various systems we've used and how they are implementing such things. But again, we had never meet an isolated auditing service. That was our goal.</p>\n<p>Here are my notes from the meeting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our goal was to track down actions happens anywhere in the system</li>\n<li>We should track the action, the actor of that action(whether it's an actual user or another service) and a lot of metadata about the action.</li>\n<li>Actions are application level logic. This means that each of our applications (otherwise services) define their actions that want our service to track. There are no limitations, validations or anything like that. There are rules that must be followed but other than that, you are free to track what ever you want.</li>\n<li>We found a solution to allow the presenter of the audits to not have to render the message it self, instead we are generating a message directly from the data we receive so the presenter can take ready messages to display. Of course, it has the choice to rerender them itself.</li>\n</ul>",id:"/home/travis/build/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/blog/our-auditing-service/index.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark",timeToRead:1,frontmatter:{date:"2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z",path:"/drafts/our-auditing-service/",tags:null,title:"Our auditing service",draft:!0}}}}}});
